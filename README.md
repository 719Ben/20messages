## Dead Project

**This project is dead and no longer hosted on Facebook**

I recently delete my Facebook and when I did, I was first required to delete 20messages. If you are still on Facebook & want to host this, go for it! The licence is MIT. (if you do, let me know ðŸ˜„)

## About

20messages was a [Facebook Messenger](https://messengerplatform.fb.com/) bot that matched users with a random Facebook friend to chat with anonymously for 20 messages on Facebook. After 20 messages were sent, both users voted to decide whether to share their identities with each other. Their identities were only shared if both users agreed.

## FAQs

### Can it message any friend?

No, only friends who are also using 20messages.

### Why did I have to authorize an application when starting?

Facebook doesn't give Messenger bots permissions to look at friend lists by default, so the extension has to request the extra permission. The extension is only able to look at friends who have also signed up for 20messages.

### Can I send images?

![Yes](https://media.giphy.com/media/2dJ5Iait4QrW8/giphy.gif)
